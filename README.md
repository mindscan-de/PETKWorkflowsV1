# The Project

This project is the runtime project for the PETKCompilerV1 project. This is to play with the idea, 
on how to write LLM Workflows, such that they can be run by the PromptEngineeringToolkit. Which
tuns out to be a kind of VM for LLM worflows.

## This is Work in Progress

Do not expect some cool things here, Here i figure out, how the DSL may should look like. Therefore
most of the usecases will be somehw useless.
